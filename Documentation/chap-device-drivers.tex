\chapter{Device drivers}

\section{Introduction}

The purpose of a device driver is to act as an intermediate layer
between an operating-specific API that is common for a group of
similar devices and vendor-specific interfaces for individual types of
devices. 

An important part of writing device drivers for a Lisp operating
system is therefore to specify the different groups of devices and the
corresponding operating-specific API for each group.%
\footnote{As everything else in this document, this chapter is open to
  discussion.  More so here, because I have no prior experience in
  defining device-driver APIs. -- RS}
