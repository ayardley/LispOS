\chapter{Checkpointing}
\label{chap-checkpointing}

The address of an object can be considered as consisting of two parts:
the \emph{page number} and the \emph{offset within the page}.  The
page number directly corresponds to the location on disk of the page.
However, when checkpointing is activated, the available disk memory is
divided into three parts, and the page number should be multiplied by
3 to get the first of three pages where the object might be located.%
\footnote{The price to pay for checkpointing is thus that disk memory
  will cost a factor 3 as much compared to the price when no
  checkpointing is used.}
